# DesB-Docking
Docking DesB with Autodock Vina and MGL Tools

Docked substrate conformations are in the results folder.
These results can be opened in PyMol together with the enzyme pdbqt "DesB_6XBBB.pdbqt".
*NOTE: The first substrate conformation is the best one thermodynamically.*

Grid file is specific to the enzyme and is configured with conf.txt to be run iteratively with dock.py
The structures in dock.py can be changed to reflect other enzymes and substrates to be docked as long as the configuration and grid files are updated.
